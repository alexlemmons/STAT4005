```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
alcohol_df <- read_csv(here("data/alcohol.csv"))

map <- map_data("world", region = ".", exact = FALSE)

map2 <- map %>%
  mutate(country = region)

map2 <- full_join(alcohol_df, map2, by = "country")

ggplot(data = map2, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", aes(fill = beer_servings)) +
  coord_map(projection = "mercator", xlim=c(-180,180)) +
   scale_fill_viridis_b()

What if you were trying to look at the ratio of wine to beer drinking in each country? You could put beer_servings on the x-axis and wine_servings on the y-axis and have a dot plot with each country plotted.
